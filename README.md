Boosted Regression Tree Modelling

This repository contains code and processes used to prepare AMI amplicon data for Species Distribution Modelling using, for example, boosted regression trees or random forrests.

Four main steps are documented:

1. Data source, cleaning and normalisation
2. Model building
3. Prediction, including extracting gridded data from local and global climatologies, such as the [CSIRO Atlas of Regional Seas](http://www.marine.csiro.au/~dunn/cars2009/)
4. Evaluation of models and predictions
